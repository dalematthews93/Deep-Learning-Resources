## Beginners
* [Berkeley Machine Learning Crash Course](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2016/11/06/tutorial-1/) - if you know absolutely nothing about machine learning start here
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) have a number of paid 'nanodegrees' such as the 'Machine Learning Engineer' nanodegree. If you are a university student you can get one month free with the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Some videos are also available for free on Udacity's YouTube page.
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/) - new book that is getting a lot of great feedback, you can access it via www.safaribooksonline.com where you can sign up for a free trial
* [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) ([YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVJA7edNhnRTYqqW5zIj0gkVmxWnkXqTP))
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf) - "One book which I think is particularly good for beginners" - Kevin Murphy. There is also an online course by the authors which follows the book [here](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about)

## Math

The most relevant areas of math to machine learning are statistics and probability, linear algebra and calculus. There are many resources for these topics. I would highly recommend [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Other options are [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
